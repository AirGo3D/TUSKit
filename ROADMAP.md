# Roadmap

- [ ] Create an example app where TUSKit is used in (would show you how to use the client from a customerâ€™s point of view. Should help evolve the API)
- [ ] Review and address issues & PRs in GitHub until there are zero
- [ ] Create a release blog post on tus.io with the changes from 2.x to 3.x and some usage examples
